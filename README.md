## Guild Chat App

This simple chat application uses Firebase Cloud Firestore and React!

### Setup

To run the app, please clone the repository and install dependencies with `yarn install`

Once complete, you can run the app locally with `yarn start`.

If a new window does not open, you can find it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Chat log

The messages in the chat log persist thanks to the use of Firestore.

### Future goals

This app was developed in a short amount of time and there are many other features I would like to add. 

- Authentication and user only chat logs.
- Ability to delete messages
- Ability to choose from a group of users and create new users.
- String sanitization in the input field.
- User identified messages.
- Emoji support.
- Much much more...


- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
